## Kubernetes Design Patterns

Design patterns are the formalization of best practices for everyday problems. Using design patterns in everyday, professional life creates a common language and communication platform for you to work on. In real life, seasoned engineers do not explain how to convert one interface into another; instead, they decide to implement an adapter. Design patterns hide the complexity and details of communication and create a common platform. In addition, converting business requirements into code is more comfortable with the accumulated knowledge of design patterns.

Kubernetes is the uprising and prominent open source container orchestration system, designed by Google. Its fundamental features include automation, scaling, and scheduling of containerized applications. To have a scalable and reliable cloud-native application, Kubernetes is a crucial part of your toolset. All levels of companies, from start-ups to large enterprises, are using Kubernetes to install and manage cloud-native applications.

This paradigm shift in software development began by creating microservices instead of chunks of large software systems. The "new" best practices have aligned with the de facto cloud-native orchestration tool, Kubernetes. Throughout this book, Kubernetes design patterns and extension capabilities will be presented. The book starts by explaining best practices to show how to create Kubernetes-native applications. Following that, accessing Kubernetes itself programmatically and enriching the best orchestration tool ever created will be explained. Finally, Kubernetes itself will be extended with a higher level of automation. At the end of the day, you will have the technical knowledge and hands-on experience to not only create applications to run on Kubernetes but also extend the system itself.

In this first section, Kubernetes design patterns will be presented, starting with the fundamentals of design patterns. Following that, you will build Kubernetes solutions using structural patterns, assemble systems with behavioral patterns, and finally, install applications according to the deployment strategies.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Define the fundamentals of design patterns
-   Explain the classification of patterns
-   Use Kubernetes design patterns to solve real-life problems
-   Build solutions using structural patterns
-   Assemble complex systems with behavioral patterns
-   Install applications with deployment strategies

## Software Design Patterns

In software development, a design pattern is a repeatable solution to a widespread problem, since it is ubiquitous to solve the same problems you have encountered before. There are two main advantages of design patterns. The first advantage is that they are proven solutions, and the second one is that they create a communication platform between developers. With these advantages, templates and specifications have been formalized over the years to create a knowledge and experience pool.

Design patterns are not finished designs that can be transformed directly into code â€“ they are only best practices and set of approaches.

Software development is seen as a relatively young and evolving field of study; however, most of the problems solved in various circumstances are similar. For instance, it is common to create a single instance component in various software systems, such as payment systems, log managers, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, or online games. Therefore, making use of past collected knowledge helps development teams to advance rapidly.

Design patterns and corresponding business requirements could seem artificial and only software-related. However, both problems and solutions have roots in real life. For instance, the singleton pattern is proposed as a best practice for implementing a configuration manager. With the same approach in mind, the adapter pattern is proposed as a best practice to work with both versions of the APIs. As its name implies, it is a similar approach in real-life to using electrical adapters to work with the different plug and socket types in various countries. As these examples indicate, software design patterns and the ideas behind them all come from real-life experiences.
