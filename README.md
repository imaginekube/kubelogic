## ‚õµ Kubernetes

There is a template over at [imaginestudio-io/flux-cluster-template](https://github.com/imaginestudio-io/flux-cluster-template) if you wanted to try and follow along with some of the best practices utilized right here.

### Initial Installation

Our [k3s](https://k3s.io/) clusters are provisioned using the [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) galaxy role [ansible-role-k3s](https://github.com/PyratLabs/ansible-role-k3s). They are simultaneously provisioned with [kube-vip](https://kube-vip.chipzoller.dev/) to create a load balancer for control plane, and [metal-lb](https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/) for its service `LoadBalancer` overlayed on Ubuntu VM Server's. There are hyper-converged as well as semi-hyper converged clusters, workloads and block storage that sharing the differing resources on our internally and externally exposed nodes,backed with HA (NFS) file storage servers.

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my cluster based on the YAML manifests.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the [kubernetes/apps](./kubernetes/apps) folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations. Those Flux kustomizations will generally have a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application underneath it which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
üìÅ kubernetes      # Kubernetes cluster defined as code
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ bootstrap     # Flux installation
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ flux          # Main Flux configuration of repository
‚îî‚îÄüìÅ apps          # Apps deployed into my cluster grouped by namespace (see below)
```

### Cluster layout

Below is a a high level look at the layout of how my directory structure with Flux works. In this brief example you are able to see that `authelia` will not be able to run until `glauth` and  `cloudnative-pg` are running. It also shows that the `Cluster` custom resource depends on the `cloudnative-pg` Helm chart. This is needed because `cloudnative-pg` installs the `Cluster` custom resource definition in the Helm chart.

```python
# Key: <kind> :: <metadata.name>
GitRepository :: home-ops-kubernetes
    Kustomization :: cluster
        Kustomization :: cluster-apps
            Kustomization :: cluster-apps-authelia
                DependsOn:
                    Kustomization :: cluster-apps-glauth
                    Kustomization :: cluster-apps-cloudnative-pg-cluster
                HelmRelease :: authelia
            Kustomization :: cluster-apps-glauth
                HelmRelease :: glauth
            Kustomization :: cluster-apps-cloudnative-pg
                HelmRelease :: cloudnative-pg
            Kustomization :: cluster-apps-cloudnative-pg-cluster
                DependsOn:
                    Kustomization :: cluster-apps-cloudnative-pg
                Cluster :: postgres
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Multi-Cloud Integrated Deployment Options

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are selfhosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about two things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios and (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not.

The alternative solution to these two problems would be to host a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud and deploy applications like [HCVault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/), and [Gatus](https://gatus.io/). However, maintaining another cluster and monitoring another group of workloads is a lot more time and effort than I am willing to put in.

</details>

### Ingress Controller

Over WAN, I have port forwarded ports `80` and `443` to the load balancer IP of my ingress controller that's running in my Kubernetes cluster.

[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) works as a proxy to hide my homes WAN IP and also as a firewall. When not on my home network, all the traffic coming into my ingress controller on port `80` and `443` comes from Cloudflare. In `VyOS` I block all IPs not originating from the [Cloudflares list of IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/).

### Internal DNS

[CoreDNS](https://github.com/coredns/coredns) is deployed on my `VyOS` router and listening on `:53`. All DNS queries for _**my**_ domains are forwarded to [k8s_gateway](https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway) that is running in my cluster. With this setup `k8s_gateway` has direct access to my clusters ingresses and services and serves DNS for them in my internal network.

### Ad Blocking

The upstream server in CoreDNS is set to NextDNS which provides me with AdBlocking for all devices on my network.

### External DNS

[external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) is deployed in my cluster and configure to sync DNS records to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). The only ingresses `external-dns` looks at to gather DNS records to put in `Cloudflare` are ones that have an annotation of `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target`

# ‚öôÔ∏è GitOps

GitOps is a set of best practices where the entire code delivery process is controlled via Git, including infrastructure and application definition as code and automation to complete updates and rollbacks.

The core idea of GitOps is to have a git repository that contains declarative descriptions of the desired infrastructure in the production environment and has an automated process to make the production environment match the state described in that repository.

Now that we know the central idea, let's go back a little bit to the acronym GitOps and let's understand the role of git, the role of ops and how they meet.

The Key GitOps Principles:

- The entire system (infrastructure and applications) is described declaratively.
- The canonical desired system state is versioned in Git.
- Changes approved are automated and applied to the system.
- Software agents ensure correctness and alert on divergence.

### <img align="left" alt="Git" width="18px" src="https://cncf-branding.netlify.app/img/projects/argo/icon/color/argo-icon-color.svg" /> [Argo CD Autopilot](https://argocd-autopilot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

New users to GitOps and Argo CD are not often sure how they should structure their repos, add applications, promote apps across environments, and manage the Argo CD installation itself using GitOps.

### Example:

```bash
argocd-autopilot app create argo-events --app github.com/argoproj/argo-events/blob/master/manifests/namespace-install.yaml -p ops --wait-timeout 2m
```

### <img align="left" alt="Git" width="18px" src="https://cncf-branding.netlify.app/img/projects/argo/icon/color/argo-icon-color.svg" /> [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Argo CD automates the deployment of the desired application states in the specified target environments. Application deployments can track updates to branches, tags, or pinned to a specific version of manifests at a Git commit. See tracking strategies for additional details about the different tracking strategies available.

### <img align="left" alt="Git" width="18px" src="https://cncf-branding.netlify.app/img/projects/argo/icon/color/argo-icon-color.svg" /> [Argo Events](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/)

Argo Events is an event-driven workflow automation framework for Kubernetes which helps you trigger K8s objects, Argo Workflows, Serverless workloads, etc. on events from a variety of sources like webhooks, S3, schedules, messaging queues, gcp pubsub, sns, sqs, etc.

### <img align="left" alt="Git" width="18px" src="https://cncf-branding.netlify.app/img/projects/argo/icon/color/argo-icon-color.svg" /> [Argo Rollouts](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/)

Argo Rollouts is a Kubernetes controller and set of CRDs which provide advanced deployment capabilities such as blue-green, canary, canary analysis, experimentation, and progressive delivery features to Kubernetes.

Argo Rollouts (optionally) integrates with ingress controllers and service meshes, leveraging their traffic shaping abilities to gradually shift traffic to the new version during an update. Additionally, Rollouts can query and interpret metrics from various providers to verify key KPIs and drive automated promotion or rollback during an update.

### <img align="left" alt="Git" width="18px" src="https://cncf-branding.netlify.app/img/projects/argo/icon/color/argo-icon-color.svg" /> [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/)

Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Argo Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition).

## What is GitOps? <!-- omit in toc -->

GitOps is a way to do Kubernetes cluster management and application delivery.
It works by using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as a single source of truth for
[declarative infrastructure and applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code),
together with tools ensuring the _actual state_ of infrastructure and
applications converges towards the _desired state_ declared in Git. With Git at
the center of your delivery pipelines, developers can make pull requests to
accelerate and simplify application deployments and operations tasks to your
infrastructure or container-orchestration system (e.g. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)).

<p align="center"><img src="img/gitops_conceptual_diagram.svg" alt="Conceptual diagram of GitOps-based infrastructure" width="800px" /></p>

## Why is GitOps awesome? <!-- omit in toc -->

It [increases developer productivity](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/#key-benefits), [enhances developer experience](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/#key-benefits), [improves stability](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/#key-benefits), all while having [higher reliability](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/#key-benefits), [higher consistency](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/#key-benefits) and [stronger security guarantees](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/#key-benefits).

Modern software development practices _assume_ support for reviewing changes, tracking history, comparing versions, and rolling back bad updates; GitOps applies the same tooling and engineering perspective to managing the systems that deliver direct business value to users and customers.
